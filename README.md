### New Jokers
A list containing all of the Jokers and their various effects, as well as the other cards in this mod can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehufdjT9kCz5n27Fg7r3Jgo9ASitgImbhOztxyOh8qI/edit?usp=sharing)

### New Rarity: Thing!
Based off of the "Things" from Color Splash, these often have powerful effects that synergize well with certain enhancements!
These Jokers are quite rare, though you can get copies of these quite easily!

### New Edition: Replica!
Replica currently reduces mult by a factor of 0.9x! (Might change in later updates) 
Replica Jokers cannot be found in the shop and can only be found by copying Jokers using effects from this mod!

### New Sticker: Drained!
This is the main gameplay gimmick of this mod, disabling Jokers until you play a certain number of suits! The suit required
is determined randomly, so either keep a stock of different suits in your deck, or stock up on the new Paint Tarots!

### New Consumable Type: Battle Card!
Based off of the Battle Cards from the original game, these consumables provide unique effects! However, sometimes
you may need to fill it up with color before you can play them!

### New Tarot Type: Paint!
There are 10 colors of Paint that can be found in this mod, each corresponding to different suits! These are
used to instantly remove the Drained sticker from Jokers that require the suit that matches the paint!

### Config Settings
At the moment, you are able to play with only the new Jokers, or play with them alongside the vanilla Jokers!
You are also able to turn off Thing Jokers if they are too OP for you :3

## Planned Features
- More Consumables!
- New Sticker, Colorized!
  - Colorized is planned to be similar to Perishable, but applies Drained instead of debuffing altogether!
  - May trigger after certain number of rounds or discards!
  - This will most likely only apply to higher stakes, though this can change in the future!
- Battle Cards may require paint/suits to be played in order to be used in the future!
- Even more **custom** Jokers that can be turned on and off!
  - Custom Jokers are based off of other Mario enemies and may have abilities based off of contributions from the community!
- Boss Blinds that unlock Boss Jokers based off of the various Bosses in Mario!
- Translations to other languages!
- More config options such as:
  - Changing how rare certain things are, like Thing Jokers, Battle Cards, and Paint Cards
  - Toggle for Battle Cards, similar to the Thing Joker toggle
  - Change how common Drained Jokers are
- New Decks, Vouchers, Boosters, and Challenges!

### New Jokers
A list containing all of the Jokers and their various effects, as well as the other cards in this mod can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehufdjT9kCz5n27Fg7r3Jgo9ASitgImbhOztxyOh8qI/edit?usp=sharing)

### New Rarity: Thing!
Based off of the "Things" from Color Splash, these often have powerful effects that synergize well with certain enhancements!
These Jokers are quite rare, though you can get copies of these quite easily!

### New Edition: Replica!
Replica currently reduces mult by a factor of 0.9x!
Replica Jokers cannot be found in the shop and can only be found by copying Jokers using effects from this mod!

### New Statuses: Drained and Painted!
Drained Jokers are disabled until you play a certain number of a certain suit! If you are on Rainbow Stake, removing Drained
makes Jokers Painted instead. Painted Jokers will become Drained after a certain number of rounds.

### New Consumable Type: Battle Card!
Based off of the Battle Cards from the original game, these consumables provide unique effects! However, sometimes
you may need to fill it up with color before you can play them!

### New Tarot Type: Paint!
There are 10 colors of Paint that can be found in this mod, each corresponding to different suits! These are
used to instantly remove the Drained status from Jokers that require the suit that matches the paint!

### Other Features
- Ability to turn off vanilla Jokers (and other modded Jokers, so be careful if using this with other mods!)
- You can change the rate at which Battle Cards and Thing Jokers appear in the shop!
- You can change the rarity of Drained Jokers appearing in the shop!
- You can change if the splash and title screen shows a Paper Mario Joker or not!

### New Jokers
A list containing all of the Jokers and their various effects, as well as the other cards in this mod can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehufdjT9kCz5n27Fg7r3Jgo9ASitgImbhOztxyOh8qI/edit?usp=sharing)

### New Rarity: Thing!
Based off of the "Things" from Color Splash, these often have powerful effects that synergize well with certain enhancements!
These Jokers are quite rare, though you can get copies of these quite easily!

### New Edition: Replica!
Replica currently reduces mult by a factor of 0.9x! (Might change in later updates) 
Replica Jokers cannot be found in the shop and can only be found by copying Jokers using effects from this mod!

### New Status: Drained!
This is the main gameplay gimmick of this mod, disabling Jokers and Consumables until you play a certain number of suits! The suit required
is determined randomly, so either keep a stock of different suits in your deck, or stock up on the new Paint Tarots!

### New Status: Painted!
This is a new status for Jokers, another major part of this mod! On higher stakes (Rainbow Stake and Above), when Drained Jokers have
their condition met, they become Painted for a number of rounds. Once the rounds are up, they go back to being Drained!

### New Consumable Type: Battle Card!
Based off of the Battle Cards from the original game, these consumables provide unique effects! However, sometimes
you may need to fill it up with color before you can play them!

### New Tarot Type: Paint!
There are 10 colors of Paint that can be found in this mod, each corresponding to different suits! These are
used to instantly remove the Drained status from Jokers that require the suit that matches the paint!

### Other Features
- Ability to turn off vanilla Jokers (and other modded Jokers, so be careful if using this with other mods!)
- Ability to turn off Thing Jokers and Battle Cards
- You can change the rate at which Battle Cards and Thing Jokers appear in the shop!
- You can change the rarity of Drained Jokers appearing in the shop!

## Planned Features

- Translations to other languages!
- New Decks, Vouchers, and Challenges!
